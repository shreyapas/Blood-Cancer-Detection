Blood cancer, also known as leukemia, is a life-threatening disease that requires early and accurate diagnosis for effective treatment. In this project, we present an innovative approach for the detection and classification of blood cancer using deep learning techniques. Specifically, we employ the MobileNetV2 architecture implemented in Python to achieve remarkable results in terms of accuracy. The dataset utilized for this research is the "Blood Cells Cancer (ALL) dataset," comprising four distinct classes: Benign, [Malignant] early Pre-B, [Malignant] Pre-B, and [Malignant] Pro-B. This dataset contains a total of 3242 peripheral blood smear (PBS) images. Accurate diagnosis of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) through PBS images is a critical step in the early screening of cancer cases. Our deep learning model, based on the MobileNetV2 architecture, has demonstrated exceptional performance. During training, it achieved an impressive accuracy of 98.00%, showcasing its ability to effectively distinguish between different types of blood cancer cells. Furthermore, the validation accuracy of 96.00% emphasizes the robustness and generalization capability of our model. This project not only highlights the potential of deep learning in the field of medical image analysis but also contributes to the early detection and classification of blood cancer, ultimately improving patient outcomes. The utilization of MobileNetV2 and Python makes our solution both efficient and accessible for healthcare professionals, paving the way for enhanced cancer screening and diagnosis.
